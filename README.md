# Overview

A project to find customer pain points by using signals from the world (e.g social media, product reviews) to provide product managers with the ability to improve on existing products or develop new products (e.g. help them pivot based on discovered pain points or develop a brand new product based on the discovered pain points.) This will improve product discovery time from months of human time to hours.

Research questions:

1. Can we successfully discover pain points from input data (e.g. social media data or amazon product review data)?

2. Can a large language model be used to accurately extract and find pain points that are useful to a product manager? 

3. Can a question and answer style chatbot trained on the right signals, provide useful pain points?
